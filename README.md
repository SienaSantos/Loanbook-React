React.js Workshop with Ryan Florence
====================================

You will need

```
git clone http://gitlab-ubuntu.git.iainnovations.com/sienasantos/Loanbook-React.git

cd Loanbook-React
npm install
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080.

This runs the webpack dev server, any changes you make to javascript
files in `loanbook` will cause the browser to reload live.
